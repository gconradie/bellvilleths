                    <li><strong>LANGUAGES</strong>&nbsp;- The Home Language and First Additional Languages, either Afrikaans or English are mandatory. &nbsp;Remedial education is provided for Afrikaans First Additional Language learners for whom this may only be a third language.</li>
                    <li><strong>SOCIAL SCIENCES</strong> - The subject Social Sciences consists of History and Geography. Both History and Geography is taught and
 assessed during every term of the school year. Although the two disciplines are kept separate, this curriculum is designed to complement the knowledge (content, skills and concepts) outlined in each.</li>
                    <li><strong>NATURAL SCIENCE </strong>- This curriculum aims to provide learners with opportunities to make sense of ideas they have about nature. It also
 encourages learners to ask questions that could lead to further research and investigation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>LIFE ORIENTATION</strong> -Life Orientation is central to the holistic development of learners. It addresses skills, knowledge and values for the
 personal, social, intellectual, emotional and physical growth of learners, and is concerned with the way in which these facets are interrelated. Life Orientation guides and prepares learners for life and its possibilities and equips them for meaningful and successful living in a rapidly changing and transforming society.</li><li><strong>MATHEMATICS</strong> - Mathematics is a language that makes use of symbols and notations to describe numerical, geometric and graphical
 relationships. It is a human activity that involves observing, representing and investigating patterns and quantitative relationships in physical and social phenomena and between mathematical objects themselves. It helps to develop mental processes that enhance logical and critical thinking, accuracy and problem-solving that will contribute in decision-making.</li><li><strong>TECHNOLOGY </strong>- Technology education was introduced into the South African curriculum in recognition of the need to produce
 engineers, technicians and artisans needed in modern society and the need to develop a technologically literate population for the modern world. The subject stimulates learners to be innovative and develops their creative and critical thinking skills. It teaches them to manage time and material resources effectively, provides opportunities for collaborative learning and nurtures teamwork. These skills provide a solid foundation for several FET subjects as well as for the world of work.</li><li><strong>CREATIVE ARTS</strong> - The main purpose of the subject Creative Arts is
 to develop learners as creative, imaginative individuals who appreciate the arts and who have the basic knowledge and skills to participate in arts activities and to prepare them for possible further study in the art forms of their choice in Further Education and Training (FET).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LANGUAGES</strong> - Language is a tool for thought and communication. It is also a cultural and aesthetic means commonly shared among
 a people to make better sense of the world they live in. Learning to use language effectively enables learners to acquire knowledge, to express their identity, feelings and ideas, to interact with others, and to manage their world. It also provides learners with a rich, powerful and deeply rooted set of images and ideas that can be used to make their world other than it is; better than it is; clearer than it is. It is through language that cultural diversity and social relations are expressed and constructed, and it is through language that such constructions can be altered, broadened and refined. &nbsp;<br><br>Language learning in Grades 10-12 at Bellville Technical High School includes two of the official languages in South Africa, namely, Afrikaans and English.<br><br><strong>Home Language</strong> level provides for language proficiency that reflects the mastery of interpersonal communication
 skills required in social situations and the cognitive academic skills essential for learning across the curriculum. Emphasis is placed on the teaching of the listening, speaking, reading and writing skills at this language level. This level also provides learners with a literary, aesthetic and imaginative ability that will provide them with the ability to recreate, imagine and empower their understandings of the world they live in.&nbsp;<br><br>By the time learners enter Grade 10, they should be reasonably proficient in their <strong>First Additional Language</strong> with
 regard to both interpersonal and cognitive academic skills. . The challenge in Grades 10-12, therefore, is to provide &nbsp;support for these learners at the same time as providing a curriculum that enables learners to meet the standards required in Grade 12. These standards must be such that learners can use their additional language at a high level of proficiency to prepare them for further or higher education or the world of work.<br><br>Immigrant learners may apply not to take Afrikaans as a First Additional Language. &nbsp;They can either take another language such as French offered by an institution outside the school, or one of our extra subjects, Information Technology or Life Science.</li>
                    <li><strong>LIFE ORIENTATION</strong> - Life Orientation is one of the four fundamental subjects required for the National Senior Certificate, which means that
 it is compulsory for all learners in Grades 10, 11 and 12. It is a unique subject in that it applies a holistic approach to the personal, social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual, motor and physical growth and development of learners. This encourages the development of a balanced and confident learner who can contribute to a just and democratic society, a productive economy and an improved quality of life for all.</li>
                    <li><strong>ENGINEERING GRAPHICS AND DESIGN</strong> -Engineering Graphics and Design (EGD) teaches internationally acknowledged principles that have both academic
 and technical applications. The emphasis in EGD is on teaching specific basic knowledge and various drawing techniques and skills so that the EGD learners will be able to interpret and produce drawings within the contexts of Mechanical Technology, Civil Technology and Electrical Technology. &nbsp;EGD is a mandatory subject.</li><li><strong>MATHEMATICS</strong>&nbsp;- The subject Mathematics in the Further Education and Training Phase forges the link between the Senior Phase
and the Higher/Tertiary Education band. All learners passing through this phase acquire a functioning knowledge of the Mathematics that empowers them to make sense of society. It ensures access to an extended study of the mathematical sciences and a variety of career paths. In the FET Phase, learners should be exposed to mathematical experiences that give them many opportunities to develop their mathematical reasoning and creative skills in preparation for more abstract mathematics in Higher/Tertiary Education institutions.</li><li><strong>TECHNICAL MATHEMATICS</strong> - Mathematical problem solving enables us to understand the world (physical, social and economic) around us, and, most
 of all, teaches us to think creatively. The aim of Technical Mathematics is to apply the Science of Mathematics to the Technical field where the emphasis is on APPLICATION and not on abstract ideas. &nbsp;The subject promotes accessibility of Mathematical content to all learners by catering for learners
 with different needs, e.g. TECHNICAL NEEDS. In the FET Phase, learners should be exposed to technical mathematical experiences that give them many opportunities
 to develop their mathematical reasoning and creative skills in preparation for more applied mathematics in HEIs or in-job training. All learners passing through this phase acquire a functioning knowledge of
 Technical Mathematics that empowers them to make sense of their Technical field of study and their place in society. &nbsp;Technical Mathematics must be taken in conjunction with Technical Science.</li><li><strong>PHYSICAL SCIENCE</strong> - Physical Sciences prepares learners for future learning, specialist learning, employment, citizenship, holistic
 development, socio-economic development, and environmental management. Learners choosing Physical Sciences as a subject in Grades 10-12, including those with barriers to learning, can have improved access to: academic courses in Higher Education; professional career paths related to applied science courses and vocational career paths. Physical Sciences plays an increasingly important role in the lives of all South Africans owing to their influence on scientific and technological development, which are necessary for the country’s economic growth and the social wellbeing of its people.</li><li><strong>TECHNICAL SCIENCE</strong> - The main aim of Technical Sciences is to support learners in the three focus areas of technology, namely Mechanical
Technology, Electrical Technology and Civil Technology. Learners will have an NQF level 4 competence in Technical Science. Learners at Technical High Schools will be able to integrate scientific knowledge in a more informed way in their subject offerings in technology. Scientific concepts and skills will be more accessible to learners that have a technical orientation in schooling. Technical Sciences will address the needs of the industry and the technology subjects by being an enabling subject to promote technology study in schools. &nbsp;Technical Science must be taken in conjunction with Technical Mathematics.</li><li><strong>ELECTRICAL TECHNOLOGY</strong> - cut down the development time with drag-and-drop website builder.
